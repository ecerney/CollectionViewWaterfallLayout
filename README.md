CollectionViewWaterfallLayout
========================

Pinterest inspired layout for UICollectionViews

**Note: Updated for Swift 5.0. This was a big upgrade from Swift 2.0, so please submit an issue / fix if you run into anything. Thanks!**

**CollectionViewWaterfallLayout** is a subclass of [UICollectionViewLayout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UICollectionViewLayout_class/Reference/Reference.html) written completely in Swift. This class is based off [CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout](https://github.com/chiahsien/CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout) which was written by [chiahsien](https://github.com/chiahsien) in Objective-C. This class tries to use as many new Swifty things to keep the code updated with current design patterns.

The original layout was inspired by [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/).

Prerequisites
-----------
* ARC
* iOS 8+
* Xcode 10+
* Swift 5.0

Installation
-----------
## Cocoapods
CollectionViewWaterfallLayout is available through CocoaPods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```
pod "CollectionViewWaterfallLayout"
```

## Swift Package Manager

CollectionViewWaterfallLayout can be installed via Swift Package Manager. To use it in your project, open Xcode, go to menu File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency, and paste this repo's URL:
```
https://github.com/ecerney/CollectionViewWaterfallLayout.git
```

How to Use
-----------

Make sure to import the pod in the files you plan to use it in:
```
import CollectionViewWaterfallLayout
```

Check out the demo project for an example using storyboards to set up the views, and that programmatically creates and customizes the waterfall layout.

#### Customizable Properties
Below are the public properties and their default values that you can change to customize the layout
``` swift
var columnCount: Int = 2
var minimumColumnSpacing: Float = 10.0
var minimumInteritemSpacing: Float = 10.0
var headerHeight: Float = 0.0
var footerHeight: Float = 0.0
var headerInset: UIEdgeInsets = .zero
var footerInset: UIEdgeInsets = .zero
var sectionInset: UIEdgeInsets = .zero
```

#### Required Protocol
Your collection view's delegate must conforms to `CollectionViewWaterfallLayoutDelegate` protocol and implement the required method, all you need to do is return the original size of the item:

``` swift
func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> CGSize
```

#### Optional Protocol
You can customize the layout properties dynamically by using the following optional protocol methods:

``` swift
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, heightForHeaderInSection section: Int) -> Float

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, heightForFooterInSection section: Int) -> Float

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, insetForSection section: Int) -> UIEdgeInsets

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, insetForHeaderInSection section: Int) -> UIEdgeInsets

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, insetForFooterInSection section: Int) -> UIEdgeInsets

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout: UICollectionViewLayout, minimumInteritemSpacingForSection section: Int) -> Float
```

Limitation
----------
* Only vertical scrolling is supported.
* No decoration view.
